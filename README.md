# Luca Brugaletta — Machine Learning Engineer

Based in **Rotterdam, Netherlands**.  
I build and ship **computer vision** and **geospatial ML** systems end-to-end: data pipelines → training → deployment.

## What I work on
- **Dense prediction / segmentation** (CV + remote sensing)
- **Data + training pipelines** (dataset construction, evaluation, reproducibility)
- **ML-backed services** (APIs, containers, deployment/monitoring)
